# 3. A3: User Interface Prototype

This user interface prototype has the main goals of helping to identify and analyse the user requirements and preview the user interface of the website to be developed.  
This artifact includes an overview of the interface and common features, a sitemap and the identification and description of the main user interactions (UI) with the system.

## 3.1 Interface and commmon features
**Xekkit** is a web application based on HTML5, JavaScript and CSS. The user interface was implemented using the Bootstrap framework.

 2. Navbar  
 3. Content 
 4. Footer 


In this figure some characteristics common to all the pages are highlighted:

We opted for a "net design" to have a flowing web page layout that suits any screen size.
The common links to the various pages maintain their position to make the user experience consistent.
Different sections have clearly distinct styles in order to highlight distinct hierarchies of information, and assist with the visual flow.

## 3.2 Sitemap

The site map gives the team an idea of the website structure and pages hierarchy.
