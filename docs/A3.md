 4. Footer 


In this figure some characteristics common to all the pages are highlighted:

The web design implemented has a fully responsive flow which allows the web page layout to suit any screen size and resolution greater than or equal to a 4'' smartphone.
The common links to the various pages maintain their position to make the user experience consistent.
Different sections have clearly distinct styles in order to highlight distinct hierarchies of information, and assist with the visual flow.

## 3.2 Sitemap

The site map gives the team an idea of the website structure and pages hierarchy.
