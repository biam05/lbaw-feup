## A6: Indexes, triggers, user functions, transactions and population

> Brief presentation of the artefact goals.

This artefact contains: 
- the physical schema of the database;
- the identification and characterisation of the indexes
- the support of data integrity rules with triggers
- the definition of the database user-defined functions
- the database's workload
- the complete database creation script, including all SQL necessary to define all integrity constraints, indexes and triggers
  
This artefact shows the database transactions needed to assure the integrity of the data in the presence of concurrent accesses.

For each transaction, the isolation level is explicitly stated and justified and read-only transactions to improve global performance are identified and justified. This artefact also contains the database's workload as well as the complete database creation script,

### 2. Proposed Indices

#### 2.1. Performance Indices

> Indices proposed to improve performance of the identified queries.  

| **Index**           | IDX01                                  |
| ---                 | ---                                    |

#### 2.2. Full-text Search Indices 

> The system being developed must provide full-text search features supported by PostgreSQL. Thus, it is necessary to specify the fields where full-text search will be available and the associated setup, namely all necessary configurations, indexes definitions and other relevant details.  

| **Index**           | IDX01                                  |
| ---                 | ---                                    |
| **Related queries** | SELECT01, ...                          |
| **Relation**        | Relation where the index is applied    |
| **Attribute**       | Attribute where the index is applied   |
| **Type**            | B-tree, Hash, GiST or GIN              |
| **Clustering**      | Clustering of the index                |
| **Justification**   | Justification for the proposed index   |
| `SQL code`                                                  ||

### 3. Triggers
 
> User-defined functions and trigger procedures that add control structures to the SQL language or perform complex computations, are identified and described to be trusted by the database server. Every kind of function (SQL functions, Stored procedures, Trigger procedures) can take base types, composite types, or combinations of these as arguments (parameters). In addition, every kind of function can return a base type or a composite type. Functions can also be defined to return sets of base or composite values.  

| **Trigger**      | TRIGGER01                              |
| ---              | ---                                    |
| **Description**  | Trigger description, including reference to the business rules involved |
| `SQL code`                                             ||

### 4. Transactions
 
> Transactions needed to assure the integrity of the data.  

| SQL Reference   | Transaction Name                    |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Justification   | Justification for the transaction.  |
| Isolation level | Isolation level of the transaction. |
| `Complete SQL Code`                                   ||

### 5. Complete SQL Code
 
> The database script must also include the SQL to populate a database with test data with an amount of tuples suitable for testing and with plausible values for the fields of the database.  
> This code should also be included in the group's git repository as an SQL script, and a link include here.
