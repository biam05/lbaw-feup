## A5: Relational Schema, validation and schema refinement

The artifact presented in this section contains the Relational Schema obtained by mapping from the Conceptual Data Model (A4). 

### 1. Relational Schema TODO

> The Relational Schema includes the relation schemas, attributes, domains, primary keys, foreign keys and other integrity rules: UNIQUE, DEFAULT, NOT NULL, CHECK.  
> Relation schemas are specified in the compact notation:  

| Relation reference | Relation Compact Notation                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| R01                | auth_user(__id__, username **UK NN**, email **UK NN**, password **NN**, description, photo, reputation **NN**, is_moderator **NN**, is_banned **NN**, is_partner **NN**) |
| **R02**            | notification(__id__, action **NN**) |
| R03                | vote(__id__, value **NN**) |
| R04                | ban(__id__, start **NN**, end **NN** **CK** end > start) |
| R05                | mod_request(__id__, reason **NN**) |
| R06                | content(__id__, body **NN**, date **NN** **DF** Today) |
| R07                | news(__id__, ) |
| R08                | comment(__id__, ) |
| R09                | tag(__id__, ) |
| R10                | faq(__id__, ) |
| R10                | status(__id__, value) |

### 2. Domains TODO

> The specification of additional domains can also be made in a compact form, using the notation:  

| Domain Name | Domain Specification           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ |
|             |                                |

### 3. Schema validation TODO

> To validate the Relational Schema obtained from the Conceptual Model, all functional dependencies are identified and the normalization of all relation schemas is accomplished. Should it be necessary, in case the scheme is not in the Boyce–Codd Normal Form (BCNF), the relational schema is refined using normalization.  

| **TABLE R01**   | User               |
| --------------  | ---                |
| **Keys**        | { id }, { email }  |
| **Functional Dependencies:** |       |
| FD0101          | id → {email, name} |
| FD0102          | email → {id, name} |
| ...             | ...                |
| **NORMAL FORM** | BCNF               |

> If necessary, description of the changes necessary to convert the schema to BCNF.  
> Justification of the BCNF.  

### 4. SQL Code TODO

> SQL code necessary to build (and rebuild) the database.  
> This code should also be included in the group's git repository as an SQL script, and a link include here.
